# Multi-draggable drag-and-drop functionality

[You can try the deployed app here!](https://tororosoba0534-dnd.herokuapp.com/) (touch-screen devices such as mobile phones are NOT supported)

This app implement drag-and-drop utility which enables you to

- select multiple items
- drag and drop all of them at once

I used to plan to implement this functionality in [Collab-Note-YJS](https://github.com/tororosoba0534/collab-note-yjs-client), found to be very hard task.

If you succeed in combine this utility into [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) or [Tip Tap](https://tiptap.dev/), please give me advice😭
